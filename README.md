Hi EveryOne In this code we have created a career guidance UI design using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
In this UI I we have added some important modern UI designs like glassmorphism, and some neomorphism.
This UI page is also modified for mobile devices by using the media screen property in css.
We have also included some transition effects in this Design.
The style.css page is a separated from the code so that it will be easy to handle all HTML files designs in one single file.
It will also helps us to use the same design in both html files without writing it twice.
